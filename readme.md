# EOS tokens
> The ultimate collection of all EOS tokens (PR welcome !).

## Why

There are over 3000 tokens on EOS mainnet (According to [EOSPark Tokens](https://eospark.com/tokens)).

Unfortunately, it's hard for developers to collect all the tokens' logo and other info. Thus limited the chance to provide a better user experience for users.

This lib aims to collect all the tokens and their data including their **logo/precision/desc/website, etc.**
